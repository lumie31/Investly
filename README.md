# Investly

Investly gives everyone the opportunity to invest in property by disrupting the status quo.

 This is lending and investing without the banks. Mortgages simplified. We connect people who want to invest their money, with investments to those who want to borrow. 
 
 One of the important parts of our business is to give our investors a way to invest in a loan for them to earn a return (monthly interest payment).

## Built with
- React.js - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Material UI - React components for faster and easier web development.

## How I approached planning?
Since time was of the essence in completing this exercise, I made use of tools that helped me bootstrap the application so that I would not waste time re-inventing the wheel. Some of those tools are:
- create-react-app: To bootstrap my React App
- Material UI: To use pre-defined components to ensure faster development
